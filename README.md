# AirportSimulator

Project Intro

A small airfield in Laois is considering expanding its capacity and needs design its new systems. 
For now, they would like to see an AirportSimulator that can simulate planes taking off and landing 
at the airport.

Project Brief

Develop a Java programme that meets the following requirements:
•	Keep track of the status of each plane: Parked, Taxiing, Taking-off, Waiting, and Landed.
•	Keep track of the properties of each plane: flight number, city its travelling to/from, which runway it’s been allocated.
•	There are two runways.
•	Ensure that no planes are taking-off or landing at the same runway at the same time.
•	Be able to get all the planes that are at each stage (ie their status).
•	Save the current state of the entire AirportSimulator system to a file.
